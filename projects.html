              optimization methods based on evolutionary algorithms and
              statistical modelling techniques for real-world problems
              (Collaboration Spain)</a><br />
            The main objective of this project is to develop methodological and
            theoretical results for the solution of general and complex
            multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) with advanced
            optimization methods based on evolutionary algorithms and
            probabilistic graphical models. To advance the state of the art in
            the methods for MOPs we plan to address the solution of the
            following questions: 1) Conception of competent multi-objective
            evolutionary algorithms (Comp-MOEAs) that incorporate probabilistic
            modeling. 2) Application of Comp-MOEAs to the analysis of human
            brain recordings with application to the study of neurological
            diseases and brain computer interfaces. 3) Development of a
            theoretical model for the analysis of Comp-MOEAs based on the theory
            of quantitative genetics. 4) Network analysis of probabilistic
            models learned by Comp-MOEAs with the goal of knowledge extraction.
            5) Implementation of software platforms for Comp-MOEAs in Matlab and
            Python to introduce their use to industrial, teaching, and research
            applications.</li>
          <li> Bio-inspired Multi-objective algorithms: New Strategies and
            Applications in Software Engineering.<br />
            This project focuses on basic and applied research in the field of
            ​​   Bio-inspired  Computation. Basic research focuses on a topic
            that is currently a challenge: new methods to reduce the
            deterioration of the search algorithms based on Particle Swarm
            Multiobjective (Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization MOPSO)
            when applied to problems with many objectives, improving the
            convergence and diversity. The main objective of this project is to
            explore the unique characteristics of MOPSO to propose new
            approaches, some topics such as the selection of leading,
            multi-swarms, new methods for storing leaders in the external file
            will be focused. The paper also emphasizes the application of
            bioinspired algorithms multiobjetivos in Software Engineering (ES)
            area, assisting in the development and maintenance of software.
            Project implementation includes a number of stages such as review of
            literature works, design, implementation and evaluation of
            algorithms. Expected to contribute to the state of the art in the
            related field in three main directions: theoretical, empirical
            studies and implementation of algorithms .</li>
          <li>Hyper-Heuristics for Solving Mono-and Multi-objective
            Combinatorial Optimization Problems. The use of heuristics and
            meta-heuristics have been quite effective in solving  complex
            optimization problems. Currently, there are several heuristics and
            meta-heuristics available for adoption by users, but most of them
            require large knowledge to be efficiently used . In this context
            emerged the Hyper-Heuristics a Hyper-Heuristic is a high-level
            methodology for selection or automatic generation of heuristics to
            solve<br />
            complex problems (Burke et al., 2013).</li>

              <li>Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms (MOPSO)
                and techniques for dealing with Many-Objectives problems. This
                project focuses in the study of the behavior of MOPSO algorithms
                in many-objective problems. Different many-objective techniques
                have been proposed in the literature but few of them have
                studied the MOPSO behavior. The goal of this project is to study
                these issues and eventually to propose a technique most suitable
                for MOPSO. The project includes different empirical analysis to
                identify the influence of the techniques on the convergence and
                diversity of MOPSO algorithms using different many-objective
                problems. The experimental results are compared applying a
                variety of quality indicators and statistical tests.</li>
              <li>A Symbolic Fault Prediction Model Based on Multi-objective
                Particle Swarm Optimization. In the literature the
                fault-proneness of classes, methods or modules has been used to
                devise strategies for reducing testing costs and efforts. In
                general, fault-proneness is predicted through a set of design
                metrics and, most recently, by using Machine Learning (ML)
                techniques. However, some ML techniques can not deal with
                unbalanced data, characteristic very common of the fault
                datasets and, their produced results are not easily interpreted
                by most programmers and testers. Considering these facts, this
                project introduces a novel fault prediction approach based on
                Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO). Exploring
                Pareto dominance concepts, the approach generates a model
                composed by rules with specific properties. These rules can be
                used as an unordered classifier, and, because of this, they are
                more intuitive and comprehensible. Different experiments will be
                accomplished, considering respectively fault-proneness of
                classes and methods. </li>
              <li>Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization applied in
                unstructured networks. This project aims to use P2P networks
                whose nodes are running multi-objective PSO algorithms. This
                study involves three aspects: 1) the spread of the topology
                between the nodes, 2) the implementation of optimization itself,
                and 3) the coordination of the trading activity of the
                optimization parameters needed between those involved nodes.
                Thus, we obtain a distributed optimization where you can take
                advantage of the features of this environment. Such
                characteristics as fault tolerance, scalability and load
                balancing are explored to obtain better results from problems
                with many objectives with regard to the quality of results and
                time to solve them, because the activity can be performed
                simultaneously in several nodes independently.</li>
